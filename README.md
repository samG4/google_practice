# Cracking the Coding Interview - Kotlin Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to problems from *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle Laakmann McDowell, implemented in **Kotlin**. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills and improve Kotlin proficiency by tackling these widely recognized coding challenges.

## Why Kotlin?
- Concise and expressive syntax
- Null safety and functional programming features
- Strong type inference and extension functions
- Industry relevance, especially in Android development

## Structure
Problems are categorized based on the chapters in *Cracking the Coding Interview*:
- **Arrays and Strings** [DONE]
- **Linked Lists** [DONE]
- **Stacks and Queues** [NOT STARTED]
- **Recursion and Dynamic Programming** [NOT STARTED]
- **Sorting and Searching** [NOT STARTED]
- **Graphs and Trees** [IN PROGRESS]
- **Bit Manipulation** [NOT STARTED]
- **Mathematical and Logical Puzzles** [NOT STARTED]

Each problem includes:
- **Solution in Kotlin** (Well-structured code)
- **Edge Cases Considered** (Handling special scenarios)

Use an IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Android Studio** to clone.
